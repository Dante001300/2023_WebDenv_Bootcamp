https://appbrewery.github.io/flexboxfroggy/   this is the exercise
the goal is to move the frog to the circle

1. flex children: is the element within the container(the parent)

2. flex parent: the container the div 

3. order: order of the element of the childrens
    .green{ order: 1 or 2 3 4 5 6 the smallest go first the biggest go last}

4. flex-warp: nowarp;[default setting of flex-warp] when you have to many items or the item is too big then 
    it willl no go into the next line so that's when we need flex-warp 
so to push the elements that don't have enough space to the next line use ---> flex-wrap: wrap;

5. justify-content: flex-start; this one set on the parent container. Justify-content set the distribution 
of the item along the main-axis
    5.1.flex-start; the element will bunched up to the left basically it will stack from the left
    5.2.flex-end; the element will bunch up to the end
    5.3. center; center the element
    5.4. space-between; space between the element evenly

6. align-items: flex-start;  this will set the height of the container(the parent)
    height: 70vh;
    6.1. align-self: flex-start; align-self will separte the element from the parent

7. align-content: center; only works if flex-wrap: wrap; is set to wrap
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-center:center;
    height: 70vh;
