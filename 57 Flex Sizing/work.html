Flex sizing: Content width < Width < Flex-Basis < min-width/max-width

flex-Basis: is a way to set width on row-base flexbox  or heigh column-base flexbox(main axis) [width of each items]
content width: for exmaple: the width of a <p> 
min/max-width: max-width looks at the longest posible line on text/ min-width looks at the longest words
width: basically the width of the screen on css

flex grow and flex shrink:
        flex-basis: 100px
        flex-grow:1;    all element will start out at 100px then grow the width of all elements until the width of container max out
        flex-shrink:1; all element will starts out at 100px then will shrink until reach minmum width (content width)
        alternative for the 3 lines above is -----> flex: 1 1 0; == flex=1; [grow shrink basis]
